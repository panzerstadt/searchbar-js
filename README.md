# Search, but with context

> A searchbar that takes into account the context in which you last remembered your stuff

- where were you when you last remembered that item/fact that you were searching for?
- when was it?
- did you remember any possibly relevant pieces of information that could help with the search?
  - "it was in Bali when I was talking to my friend about buildings, about two months ago"
